    question: "What is @thenamespace/ens-components?",
    answer:
      "It is a production-ready React component library for building ENS (Ethereum Name Service) experiences. It provides drop-in UI components for ENS name registration, profile record editing, and subname issuance — all with built-in wallet integration via wagmi and viem.",
  },

    question: "What are the peer dependencies?",
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: "Does it support testnets?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Pass isTestnet={true} to any component to switch it to Sepolia testnet. The component will use the correct ENS registry and resolver addresses for that network.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are offchain subnames?",
    answer:
      "Offchain subnames are ENS subnames created via the Namespace API without any on-chain transaction. They resolve through an EIP-3668 CCIP-Read gateway, making them instant and gas-free for end users.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are onchain subnames?",
    answer:
      "Onchain subnames are subnames mintable under ENS names that have been activated on the Namespace platform. Minting happens on-chain via a wallet transaction and gives the holder a fully decentralised, censorship-resistant subname.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get an API key for offchain subnames?",

  {
    question: "Can I customise the component appearance?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Components accept props like title, subtitle, noBorder, hideBanner, and bannerImage. The stylesheet uses CSS custom properties so you can theme the components to match your app.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the library open source?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The source is available on GitHub at github.com/thenamespace/uikit under an open-source licence.",
